//! TLS support for Comprenehsive
//!
//! TLS functionality is made available to the [`comprehensive::Assembly`]
//! through an abstract [`comprehensive::Resource`] called [`TlsConfig`]
//! which dispatches to various concrete providers. The concrete providers
//! may source TLS configuration from different places such as files on disk
//! or the local SPIFFE agent etc...All implement the trait
//! [`TlsConfigProvider`].
//!
//! TLS parameters for clients and servers will be available to the
//! assembly as long as one concrete provider is present, initialises
//! successfully, and supplies data. If more than one concrete provider
//! does so then [`TlsConfig`] will select between them using such hints
//! as might be available such as SNI; all providers will get a chance
//! to verify remote peers.
//!
//! A simple "built-in default" provider [`TlsConfigFiles`] is implemented
//! in this crate which just loads a key, certificate, and trust bundle from
//! files named on the command line. Others exist in other crates.
